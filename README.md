Youtube Visualization??? 

It categorizes videos from YouTube channels in different ways and shows them to users. It also links related videos together. 
It's using the Unity Game Engine to represent the videos on my channel in a different way. I hope you try this one I made. Also, you can try it on your end. (It works on Desktop Web Browser/Android Phone or Tablet)
